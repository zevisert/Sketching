#Game of Life

A small, simple implementation of Conway's [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

Compile typescript with `npm run start` to start a live compiler.

*Note: Ignore Errors `TS2384` about overloaded signatures. We're meant to overload P5.js's `setup` and `draw` functions at the very least*
